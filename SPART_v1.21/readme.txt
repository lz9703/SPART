# USE OF the SPART model
#
# The model is made freely available to the public and the
# scientific community in the belief that its wide dissemination
# will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# The availability of the model does not constitute publication
# of the model. We rely on the ethics and integrity of the user to 
# receive fair credit for our work. If the model is obtained for 
# potential use in a publication or presentation and is essential 
# to the work, we ask to be informed at the outset of the nature of this work. 
# This should be discussed at an early stage in the work.
